## Write Disposable Codebase

The software industry is changing at a rapid pace. Customer demand is rapidly changing which can lead development teams in unknown territory. 

But as a software developer, we are not focusing on one thing or it could be one of the blind spots which is our codebase itself. We are trying to cram every software rule in our software which can hinder progress in the long run. This could also force developers to rewrite the codebase one quarter.

One way to keep requirements and codebase changes at a minimum is to write disposable codebase e.g. minimize abstraction, do not wrap everything in common method until you see too many duplications or use of complex patterns.
